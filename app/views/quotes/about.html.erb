	<h1>About Splurty</h1>

	<p>Splurty was built by Matt as he expanded his coding skills with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thefirehoseproject.com/">theFirehoseProject</a>.  In addition to coding, he has a love for haunted attractions, so it only makes sense that he would relay some of what he's heard over the years at haunts while giving people the chance to share theirs as well.
